# API

The stable API of the `GRAPE` consists of the documented arguments for [`QuantumControl.optimize`](@ref) with `method=GRAPE`, and the documented properties of the [`GrapeResult`](@ref) object.

The remaining functions in `GRAPE` documented below should not be considered part of the stable API. They are guaranteed to be stable in bugfix (`x.y.z`) releases, but may change in feature releases (`x.y`).
